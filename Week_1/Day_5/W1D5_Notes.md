# Notes for Week 1, Day 5


## Troubleshooting Guide

Before you call yourself _stuck_, ask the following questions:

**Have I...**

. . . pseudo-coded the solution?

. . . google the error message?

. . . _READ_ the error message?

. . . double-checked my syntax?

. . . linted my code?

. . . pair programmed or gotten a 
peer to code review?

. . . rubber-ducked the problem?

If the answer to all of these is yes, then you've done your due diligence and should be calling a mentor over.
